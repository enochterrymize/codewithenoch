# Understanding CSS : Thinking inside the Box

Imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML Element.

### Block and Inline Elements

Block level elements look like start on a new line example
```
<h1></h1>
<p></p>
<div></div>

```

Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line
```
<b></b>,<li>,<img><em>

```
### CSS Associates style rules with HTML Elements

CSS works by associating with HTML elements. 

## CSS Rule containts two parts : a selector and a declataion 

```
p{font-family: Arial;}

```

Here p is the selector, Selector indicates which element the rule applies to.

Declaration indicate how the elements reffered to in the selector should be styled.

Declaration are split into two parts( a property and a value ) and are seperated by colon.
